# Test non-numeric types
# Note: Booleans and Strings are not literals in math blocks yet, 
# so we must define them as variables first if the parser supports it.
# Currently parser only supports number/string literals in terms.

# String literal test
s1 := "hello"
s2 := "world"
res_str := (s1 /\ s2) 
# "hello" -> [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
# "world" -> [119, 111, 114, 108, 100]
# Mean: [111.5, 106, 111, 108, 105.5] -> Array of floats

# Boolean test (if supported by parser/eval)
# Since 'true' is parsed as identifier, we need to ensure it exists or use 1.0/0.0
# But wait, Value::Bool exists. Does the parser produce it?
# The parser produces Ident("true"). The evaluator looks up "true".
# We need to define "true" in the context or fix the parser.
# For now, let's assume "true" is not defined and use a workaround if needed.
# Actually, let's define them manually to test the Value support.
true_val := 1.0 # Placeholder until bool literal support
false_val := 0.0

# Complex/Array test
c1 := [1, 2] # Real, Imag
c2 := [3, 4]
res_complex := (c1 /\ c2) # [2, 3]
